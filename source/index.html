                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>
                        Openness, accountability, and honesty define government
                        transparency. In a free society, transparency is
                        government's obligation to share information with
                        citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold their
                        public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe
                        that government should be transparent. Governments exist
                        to serve the people. Information on how officials
                        conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money
                        must be readily available and easily understood. This
                        transparency allows good and just governance.
                        Transparency promotes accountability and provides
                        information for citizens about what their Government is
                        doing. We also believe that government should be
                        participatory. Public engagement enhances the
                        Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of
                        its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society,
                        and public officials benefit from having access to that
                        dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to
                        become actively engaged in American government. TGIF
                        works to disclose information in forms that the public
                        can readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to
                        identify information of greatest use to the public.

                        <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the West, the idea that government should be open
                            to public scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion
                            dates back at least to the time of the
                            Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack
                            on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part
                            of their intellectual project. The passage of formal
                            legislative instruments to this end can also be
                            traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which
                            then included Finland as a Swedish-governed
                            territory) enacting free press legislation as part
                            of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act,
                            1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes
                            more broadly, is strongly related to recent
                            historiography on the eighteenth-century public
                            sphere. Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the
                            revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789),
                            freedom of the press enshrined provisions and
                            requirements for public budgetary accounting and
                            freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In
                            the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean
                            statesmen to row back on these measures were
                            vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal
                            politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton
                            prominent among the latter. Open government is
                            widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary
                            democratic practice and is often linked to the
                            passing of freedom of information legislation.
                            Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the
                            first freedom of information legislation, dating the
                            origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth
                            century and Finland continuing the presumption of
                            openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing
                            its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951
                            (superseded by new legislation in 1999). The United
                            States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
                            in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or
                            equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in
                            1970.
